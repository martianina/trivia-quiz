## Description

A trivia quiz game that uses the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to query questions and answers. User can initially customize the quiz by setting the number of questions, category, difficulty-level, question type (true/false or multiple-choice), and an optional time limit. After completing the quiz, the user will then see an in-depth overview of results and have the option of starting a new quiz.
